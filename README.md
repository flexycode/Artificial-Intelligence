### ðŸ§  Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.

AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). 

As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.

Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.

###### ðŸ“Š Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized. The core problems of artificial intelligence include programming computers for certain traits such as:


* ðŸ’¡ KnowledgeÂ 

* ðŸ’¡ ReasoningÂ 

* ðŸ’¡ Problem solvingÂ 

* ðŸ’¡ PerceptionÂ 

* ðŸ’¡ Learning

* ðŸ’¡ PlanningÂ 

* ðŸ’¡ Ability to manipulate and move objects

# ðŸ’« Machine Learning

#### Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research. Machines can often act and react like humans only if they have abundant information relating to the world. Artificial intelligence must have access to objects, categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement knowledge engineering. Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in machines is a difficult and tedious task.


#### ðŸ¤– Machine learning is also a core part of AI. Learning without any kind of supervision requires an ability to identify patterns in streams of inputs, whereas learning with adequate supervision involves classification and numerical regressions.

Classification determines the category an object belongs to and regression deals with obtaining a set of numerical input or output examples, thereby discovering functions enabling the generation of suitable outputs from respective inputs. Mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a well-defined branch of theoretical computer science often referred to as computational learning theory.

Machine perception deals with the capability to use sensory inputs to deduce the different aspects of the world, while computer vision is the power to analyze visual inputs with a few sub-problems such as facial, object and gesture recognition.

Robotics is also a major field related to AI. Robots require intelligence to handle tasks such as object manipulation and navigation, along with sub-problems of localization, motion planning and mapping..

## Machine Learning Algorithm

### 1. Neural NetworkÂ 
<img src="images/1.neural network.png">

* A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and consist of interconnected processing nodes that are organized into layers.

### 2. Logistic RegressionÂ 
* Logistic Regression is a Supervised statistical technique to find the probability of dependent variable.

* The Logistic Regression instead for fitting the best fit line, condenses the output of the linear function between 0 and 1.

<img src="images/2.logistic regression.png">

* In the formula of the logistic mode, when b0 + b1x = 0, then the p will be 0.5, similarly, b0 + b1x > 0, then the p will be going towards 1 and b0 + b1x < 0, then the p will be going towards 0.

### 3. Linear Regression
A Linear Regression model representation is a linear equation:
<img src="images/3.Linear Regression.png">

Learning a LR means estimating the coefficients from the training data. Common methods include Gradient Descent or Ordinary Least Squares.

#### Variations
* Lasso Regression : where OLS is modified to minimize the `sum` of the coefficients (`L1 regularization`)

* Ridge Regression : where OLS is modified to minimize the `squared sum` of the coefficients (`L2 regularization`)

### 4. Central limit theorem
For `large` sample sizes, the sampling distribution of `means` will approximate to `normal distribution` even if the population distribution is not normal.

<img src="images/4.Central limit theorem.png">

Above picture, shows 3 different `population` distributions which are `not normal`. `Sampling` distribution of `means` gets a little closer to normal distribution when we take n = 5 and almost normal distribution when `n=30` 

### 5. R-SquareÂ 
R-square(RÂ²) is also known as the `coefficient of determination`, It is the `proportion` of variation in `Y explained by` the independent variables `X`. It is the measure of goodness of fit of the model.

<img src="images/5.R-Square.png">

If RÂ² is 0.8 it means `80% of the variation` in the output can be explained by the `input variable`.

### 6. Random Forest

<img src="images/6.Random-Forest.png">

#### Random Forest
A random forest is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that trains multiple decision tress on random subsets of the data and then combines their predictions to make a final prediction. This can improve the performance of the model compared to using a single decision tree.
